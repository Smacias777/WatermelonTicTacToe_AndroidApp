# WatermelonTicTacToe_AndroidApp
## Concept Summary
This android application gives a new look to the famous game of Tic-Tac-Toe. With a watermelon theme, users can play in both single and two-player modes.
The single-player mode having two options, either facing an easy or hard AI.  

**Single Player Mode:**
When selected, it takes the user to a screen where you are able to choose the difficultly. If "Very Easy" is selected, the game will be quite simple and easy to win.
The program selects a random available location as its choice. Thus, the user will have the opportunity to win almost every time. If "Very Hard" is selected, the game will be impossible to win. It uses the minimax algorithm to determine the most optimal position. Therefore, no matter how much the user tries, the best they can do it
to get a tie.
The extreme of having really easy and really hard modes was part of making this application much more unique. Where the user will most likely get tired of the easy mode,
and as a natural response will go ahead and attempt to win in the "Very Hard" mode. This will sharpen the user's skills, making them much more proficient in the game. A
medium-level may be added in a later update.

**Two Player Mode:**
This allows for two players to play. The functionality is similar to that of the single player mode.
